## Introduction : 

This project is a simple Snake Game made for Android that was one of the assignments I had to deliver during the Free Online Course ["INTRODUCTION TO VIDEO GAMES CREATION"](https://cambridge-academy-of-gaming-and-innovation.teachable.com/p/introduction-to-video-games-creation) proposed by ["XAMK South-Eastern Finland University of Applied Sciences"](https://www.xamk.fi/en/frontpage/) (35 ECTS).
With this project, I was able to discover the basics of Unity Engine / C#, and thus develop my first mobile application.

## How to Play : 

The game mechanics are really simple: you control a green snake by swiping in any direction. Your goal is to make your snake eat as many eggs as possible to break score records. But be careful, each egg eaten will make the snake grow even longer. If the snake's head hits its own body, the map borders, or the randomly placed spikes, it will instantly be killed.
Regarding the spikes, after consuming a certain number of eggs, a golden egg will appear randomly on the map. Consuming it will allow you to reach the next level, making the snake a little bit longer and faster, and will also add a spike. Every level adds +1 spike. The difficulty will therefore increase gradually without really having an end.
